## Overview
GymTracker is a website where users can find a simple tool for tracking and logging their gym workouts.

GymTracker allows the user to create workouts, where they can freely add exercises, and leave a note for workout reminders. A workout name and date can be added, so the workout can be easily identified if it needs to be accessed at a later time.

This website was built as a project for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.
